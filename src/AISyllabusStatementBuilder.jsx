But there are a lot of support resources available to you, and I believe that you can succeed here. Please contact me anytime and let's talk about it.

Don’t let AI do the thinking for you or settle for generic AI content. It is important in our field to champion human voices and to be critical of how power is structured in society. My door is always open and I welcome you to reach out to me anytime to discuss how you might address AI in your work in this course.",

Also, I trust that you will take responsibility for your interactions with AI. If AI generates something inaccurate, plagiarized, biased, offensive, unethical, or incorrectly attributed, I expect you to identify and address it.
